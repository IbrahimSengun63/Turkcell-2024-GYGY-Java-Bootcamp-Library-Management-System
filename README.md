# Description

In this project, the following statements have been implemented:

Two types of users have been created: members and employees.

Members perform book rental processes. Before the rental process, logs are created.

Members process the book delivery, and if the date of receipt is 5 days before the due date, a penalty process will be recorded in the database. 

For all log statements, "log start" must be shown before logging.
